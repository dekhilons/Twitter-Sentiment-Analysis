# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with BERT and RoBERTa  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies sentiment analysis to tweets about the coronavirus, aiming to classify each tweet's sentiment as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.  

To achieve this, we utilize advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models—specifically, **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and **RoBERTa**. These transformer-based models are fine-tuned on a preprocessed dataset, enabling them to understand the nuances of social media language.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build a robust **sentiment analysis pipeline** for social media text.  
- Enhance classification accuracy through fine-tuning **BERT** and **RoBERTa** on this specialized dataset.  
- Analyze sentiment trends surrounding coronavirus tweets to gain insights into **public sentiment over time and by region**.  

## 🔍 Approach  

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**  
   - Process tweets by removing unnecessary characters, special symbols, and emojis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Perform initial analysis of tweet frequency and sentiment distribution.  

3. **Text Preprocessing and Tokenization**  
   - Prepare the text data in a format compatible with **BERT** and **RoBERTa** models.  

4. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**  
   - Fine-tune transformer models on the tweet dataset.  

5. **Evaluation and Interpretation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and precision.  
   - Visualize and interpret sentiment trends.  

## 📊 Tools & Technologies  
- **Transformers**: BERT, RoBERTa  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face, PyTorch, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Results  
- High accuracy and F1-scores on tweet sentiment classification tasks.  
- Clear insights into public sentiment trends during the coronavirus pandemic.
